# pong_game_python

Its a Pong game project that uses Python programming language and the Python library called Turtle. The game is built using object-oriented programming concepts. The first step in coding Pong in Python is to set up your development environment. This includes installing Python, installing a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE), and installing the Turtle module1. I can create two paddles A and B on the left and right side of the screen, create a ball, create an event to move the paddle vertically the left paddle by pressing 'w' and 's' and the right paddle by pressing '8' and '5', if every hitting a ball the ball speed will increase and create the function to update the score after each player misses a collision
